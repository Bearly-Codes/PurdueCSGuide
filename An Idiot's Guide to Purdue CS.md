# An Idiot's Guide to Purdue CS



### My Perspective
I'm a rising senior in Purdue Computer science. I'm not a prodigy, Zuckerberg hasn't banged on my door to offer me 13 billion dollars to help him build a god and then use it to improve the Instagram reccomendation algorithm, but I've done pretty well. I've got two years of TA experience, gotten As in almost all of my CS classes, and had some success with both internship and job hunting.

The following is my advice to incoming freshmen (and students at every level, really). It's probably most applicable to Computer Science students who are similar to me, so don't be afraid to pick and choose the advice you follow. Some of it may work for you, some of it may not. We're all different people and the advice that guides one person to a 4.0 might send another into a mental hospital. With all that being said:
### Don't Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate level classes, do research, take all the hardest classes, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester you're already behind. In fact you should've come in with AP credits, you should've tested out of CS-180. Plus you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair they _will shoot you, they will take you out back and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good for nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

The imposter syndrome in computer science is real, if you're not feeling it yet read [this](https://gist.github.com/kartva/30c528420d68869dbcf376cd028fe038). Ask anyone for advice and they'll tell you to do more, do more, do more. Before long you'll feel pulled in a thousand different directions, inadequate compared to your peers, and like you've been behind since the 10th grade because your parents didn't send you to an MIT summer camp.

You are, statistically, not a prodigy. That is okay, you need to understand that. It's really, really rough coming in to college, especially if your identity is wrapped up in being the best. You're going to encounter people smarter than you've ever met, people who are terrifyingly good at what they do, and that's going to be exciting, exhillarating, amazing. But it's not exciting yet, right now it's just scary, and that's okay.

There are some people out there who can genuinely do everything (except get an A in Hardware Security). When you ask them for advice they, like everyone else, will tell you to do more. It's easy for them, they're just that good. They've walked in with four years of experience, the early classes were a breeze, they eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff. You cannot and should not emulate them.

You only have so much energy in the day. If you try to get a 4.0 and join a club and have personal projects and do hackathons and do research and become a TA and do all the things that everyone keeps telling you to do you'll fail at multiple, hate yourself, hate life, and probably end up worse off. You have a limited amount of time and energy with which to do academic stuff. The solution isn't to do more, it's to make what you're already doing do more for you.

Don't do more, do better.
## This Is It. This Is All There Is.
"I'd like to have a girlfriend but I just don't see how I'd be able to spend any time with her" - Anonymous friend with a 4.0 GPA.

It's a good idea to grind, to focus on the future, to build a better life for yourself. I'm going to spend the rest of this guide talking about how to do just that. But don't wait to start living. Your goal isn't to be the best, or to get the best job, it's to have the best life, and you're already living life. This is it. This is all there is. If you don't start living now, you might never start at all.

Free time is not a sin, especially not if you spend it doing things you genuinely enjoy. Brainrotting on TikTok for 14 hours and skipping all your classes is a terrible idea, but forming relationships, doing fun things, feeling the touch of a member of the opposite sex, aren't wastes of time if you genuinely value them. Don't put off living, don't feel guilt for living. You need balance if you're going to make it through four years here.

But on the other hand, make sure you're actually doing things you value. It's all too easy to fall into the habit of just doing the easiest, lowest energy activity you have available (brainrotting on TikTok). If you need some time to rest and relax then sure, that's fine, but try to do more memorable and unique things. If you can't remember what you did in your free time yesterday, you probably didn't spend it very well. Optimizing your time use doesn't apply just to academics, put effort into spending your free time doing things you're proud of having done. That's why I'm going to buck the trend of Purdue CS guides and actually start with the social element.

### Friends
The first few weeks are critical. You're going to arrive on campus and for a brief, beautiful window _nobody will have friends_. Which means everyone _wants friends_, which means everyone is going to be really, really open to talking to (and hanging out with) new people. This only lasts a little while, once people have found their friend groups (and once you've found yours) they're going to spend a lot less time talking to strangers and a lot more time talking to their established friend groups.

That means you have a limited amount of time to get in at least one friend group before the whole thing becomes a lot more difficult. So spend the first week or two meeting absolutely everyone you can. Say hi, play a board game, join a group for lunch. If you don't like your BGR group, join another one. Even if you're a weird little gremlin who everyone hates, if you play the numbers game enough you're almost certain to find a group of people who at least tolerate you. You should not, and I mean ABSOLUTELY NOT just hang out with the same two people you knew from high school. Push past that social anxiety, remember they're just as afraid of you then you are of them!

Because classes are nonexistant and everyone is desperate to find someone to hang out with, you're going to have lots of opportunities to make and maintain friendships. But you can't stay friends with everyone. As classes get harder people will begin to withdraw. They'll stop hanging out with as many people and retreat to a smaller circle. This is when the core of your friend group will form. Try to keep everyone as an acquaintance (if even a distant one), but pick the best people you've met and put in an effort to keep hanging out with them, even while you're busy.

When choosing friends, pick people who you'd like to become more similar to. If someone told you that you were a lot like your friends, and that made you feel happy, then you're probably in good company. Don't just hang out with the first person to tolerate your presence, find people who you really vibe with. Also, if you have smart friends they'll help you in classes. If you don't have smart friends, then you might be the smart friend, and you'll have to help people in classes.

Beyond all that, here are a few random tips to start conversations with strangers:
1. They will not remember you unless you screw up monumentally. Like, vomit in front of them or something. People do not have enough mental bandwidth to judge strangers.
2. Use something you have in common. If they're strangers, then use something visible on their person ("oh wow is that a ___ shirt?") or something in your current environment ("Does the line always get this long?"). If they brush you off, don't force it, don't try again, just move on.
3. Don't monologue. Most people like to talk, let them. If they're talking a lot chances are they're really enjoying the conversation. Or maybe you got a fact wrong and they're correcting you. Either way they're engaged!
4. Don't aggressively steer conversations to your special interests. If they're interested, they'll bite. If they steer the conversation away, they don't want to hear about Sonic the Hedgehog.
5. Continuation of #3, try to build off shared emotions. Like you both absolutely bombing an exam.
6. Don't try to awkwardly join discussions between friends. If you're a gregarious enough person you might be able to pull it off but let's be honest, you're a Purdue CS student.

Here's how to turn people you're chatting with into friends
1. Ideally meet the same people multiple times. If you're friendly each time, it makes the following steps easier.
2. Walk with them wherever they're going (as long as it's the direction you're headed, or not too far out of your way). **Do not follow people if they don't want you there, don't be creepy**.
3. Try to meet outside of class or whatever environment you see them in. This can be as blunt as asking someone you've just met to help you study, or asking the person you're walking with if they want to get lunch together.
4. Try to make a routine. It's kinda difficult to keep asking someone to hang out. It's much easier if you know you're both going to meet on Friday to study, because that's what you do every Friday.
### Roommate(s)
Ideally with the advice above you'll have found a group of friends. From there you need to pick a roommate, and you'll need to do this earlier on in the year than you'd think. If you plan on living off campus, you'll be sharing a kitchen and a lease with them. If you're on campus, then you'll be sharing a room. This can either lead to an uncomfortable cold war with what used to be a friend, or the solidification of your already rock solid friendship into a friendship diamond that can transcend any mortal struggle.

Your roommate should, ideally, also be someone you respect and like a great deal. You should want to be more like them, because after a year in the same room you'll start to mind-meld. If your roommate is a workaholic, seeing them do work will encourage you. If they're a socialite, they'll help get you out of the dorm. If they're smart, they can help with classes. If they're an alcoholic... well...

A few red flags that are fine in friends but bad in roommates:
1. Never leaves the room. It means they'll never leave _your_ room. If that's a problem, pick someone who touches grass more.
2. Always has crazy stuff happen to them. If you're their friend, you get a front row seat. If you're their roommate, you might become involved in their drama.
3. Always in fights. They'll start fighting with you.
4. Crazy party animal. If they vomit, you might have to clean it up.
5. Snores.
6. Is a romantic interest. Don't, not until you've known them for longer than a few months.
7. Always has their romantic interest two feet away. That romantic interest will be an honorary roommate.
8. Is someone who constantly needs help or is struggling. You're likely to get wrapped up in their problems.

As a coincidence, these all apply to romantic partners too.
## The Academics
Everyone comes into college with different goals. Some people want to make their parents happy, some people want to learn as much as possible, some people want to graduate with a decent job that'll pay the bills, and some people are hell bent on proving their superiority through dominating every intellectual task thrown at them. It's up to you to figure out what kind of person you are!

I encourage you to really think about what you want out of college, ideally before you've even gone there. Write it down, make it permenant, tell your family and friends. It can change, and it really should change as you grow and mature, but setting these kinds of goals is important. Everything you do at college should be done to achieve this goal. Not to keep up with your peers, or to fit into the role of studious student. Just because everyone around you is doing something doesn't necessarily mean you should. It means you _probably_ should, because there is often wisdom in crowds, but if you want something different out of college, you'll probably end up doing different things in college.

With that being said, this guide will be written with the following goal:
**Have a memorable and positive college experience whilst setting yourself up for as good a job post-college as possible**
### Aim Big, Cut Aggressively
Before we can talk about all the stuff you should try to do, we should talk about the stuff you must do.

You must, at least, do the following:
1. Maintain your mental health to enable you to do the rest of the things on this list.
2. Pass enough classes to graduate
3. Obtain a job, eventually
4. Gather enough knowledge from college that you're not immediately fired

These are the critical four. If you don't achieve all of these, it doesn't really matter what else you did in college, you probably failed.

But I'd encourage attempting to do a lot more. It's a good idea to aim for a second major (or a minor), multiple tracks, clubs, other things I'll mention below. But before I mention all that it's worth emphasizing that you should aim big and cut aggressively. Make a list of things you could do and sort it in order of how much you think it'll help you reach your goals, meet with other people to get their input on your list. Asking on Reddit, asking your academic administrator, or running things by an upperclassman are all great methods.

Classify each thing you could do as having either a high or low quitting cost. This quitting cost is composed of two things, the immediate cost upon quitting and the invested effort you spent on the thing you quit. TAing has a high immediate cost to quit, it's not going to look good. A second major, entirely unrelated to your first, has a high invested cost to quit. It's unlikely you'll be able to use those classes for anything, and they'll represent a huge amount of wasted effort.

You should estimate the workload of your coming semester. If you quit all your low quitting cost responsibilities, it should be no higher than the amount of work you did your previous semester. The highest quitting cost activities you can have are:
1. Courses that are prerequisites, so almost all CS classes you'll be taking for the first 4 semesters.
2. TA positions at Purdue. Quit without a good excuse and you're unlikely to find another.
3. Leadership obligations. Same with #2, without a good reason you're unlikely to find another.
4. Relationships. Self explanatory.
5. Mentorship roles.
6. Classes with a focus on group projects (CS-307). If you took it with friends (which you should) you'll lose a lot of credibility.

You should have priorities, ordered by how expensive they are to quit and how valuable they are to your goals. You should start the semester with too much work, overestimate the amount of things you can do, but make sure you have a lot of stuff you can quit with no reprocussions. When anything high on the list of priorities becomes threatened (GPA, relationships) and _especially_ when any of the critical four are threatened cut, and cut aggressively.

If you're in danger of failing a class for your minor, use the time you used to be dedicating to a club to study. If you're failing a core class, drop the minor. People who are only used to success tend to aim far too low and then implode when they start failing. Do not attempt to make it all work, if you're struggling it's better to cut excess responsibility (especially if there's a low cost to quitting) than to risk any of the critical four.

Most often this will come in the form of accepting hits to your GPA. As are very difficult, Bs are much easier, and Cs are easier still. #3 on the critical four is helped by a good GPA, but it's a terrible idea to risk #1 or #2 in that process.  It might actually be optimal to accept a B in a class if it means having a weekend off when you really need it. Pushing through might result in you burning out hard and failing a class or suffering health complications.

It's always better to gracefully cut things low on your priority list rather than attempting to do it all and failing. Because when you fail, it's anyones guess what you might fail at. You could come back after an exam and shut down, unable to motivate yourself to study for the next one. You could stay up all night working on a club project and sleep through a morning meeting. You could forget about responsibilities, ignore your partner, lose friends, or have a nervous breakdown. Better to fail (or underperform) in a controlled manner than risk the things that are most important.
### Take Additional Classes
These classes can be in service of a major, minor, or just helping you graduate faster. The cost of quitting is really up to you here. If you plan things right and make sure you have easy off-ramps of transitioning majors into minors or reusing half completed minors to meet other requirements you might have no quitting cost at all. 

The best scenarios are ones in which you only need a few additional classes to get a major or minor. With the right CS classes, you only need one additional class to get a math minor. If you drop this class, you're not really losing much. All the other classes you took in service to your math minor are still helping you graduate. But if you take a bunch of classes for a major in Anthropology or something, then quit halfway through, it might end up being a massive waste of time.

It's worthwhile to schedule classes as though you're aiming for a minor, second major, or additional track(s). This results in taking more classes earlier, but even if you quit you'll still be able to use the classes you took. When in doubt, take classes that apply to multiple goals first. Delay classes that apply to only one major or track as long as possible. If you start getting overwhelmed, dropping the minor is just a matter of changing your future plans and rescheduling a few classes.
### Study Smarter
I've personally experienced quality studying methods moving me up 2 grades (B+ to A) without any corresponding increase in effort. Find people who are doing well in the classes you're in and copy their method. If it feels like it's not working, pivot quickly. Try as many things as possible until you find something that seems to work for you.

Classes often contain two things you need to study:
1. Procedural knowledge. How to do something. Like math.
2. Conceptual knowledge. What something is, does, or how it works. Like history.

All of calculus is procedural knowledge. Linear is procedural and a bit of conceptual. CS-180 changed since I took it, but it's mostly procedural. CS-240, CS-250, CS252 were a mixture of procedural and conceptual. CS-251 and CS-182 were procedural. If a class's exams involve doing some task with an objective right or wrong (FRQ coding, solving math problems), they're probably procedural. If they involve answering questions with facts or writing essays/short answers then they're probably conceptual.

Study procedural knowledge by performing the procedures you'll be tested on as often as possible, in as similar an environment to the test as possible. That means do study guides, write practice code problems for 240, 250, and 252, and do them repeatedly. Grade your work, if you did it wrong re-do it correctly. Most students will come in with only a conceptual, theoretical understanding. Practicing the procedure will make you far faster and much more correct.

Study conceptual knowledge with flashcards if it requires rote memorization (numbers, names, explicit associations between two things). If it's more complex than memorization, write free response questions and then try to write your entire understanding of a concept as fast as possible. Don't use the internet or outside help. After you're done, use the internet to edit your initial writing to make it better. Learning about paging? Write everything you know about paging down on a sheet of paper, then go to the slides to add all the facts you missed.

Do not mindlessly re-read notes except as a quick refresher before an exam. If you're not rephrasing it, remembering it, or learning it for the first time, you're probably not learning at all.
### Use TAs
I'm biased, obviously, but we do occasionally know what we're talking about. If you're stuck on something you could spend three hours figuring it out. Or you could show up to an office hour (or another lab session), ask a TA, and watch them solve it in five minutes.

Please at least attempt to solve it beforehand. Try to add a bunch of print statements and give the TAs information about what you've tried and what hasn't worked, too. It'll help us fix your issue far faster than if you just plop a computer down in front of us and go "it doesn't work". TAs become absolutely essential in CS250 and CS252 (what a coincidence... the classes I TA). 

## The Job Hunt
While academics tends to dominate the minds of students, the hunt for internships (and jobs) is equally as important. Not so much your freshman year (though you should turn up to a few career fairs to get used to it) but sophomore year and your internships can matter as much as (or more than) your grades.

Despite this, students tend to massively under-invest in finding an internship. This makes it comparatively easy to stand out in this regard as compared to something like, say, standing out in terms of GPA. Additionally, all of this stuff tends to be really low investment. Nobody's going to care if you decide that you can't show up at a career fair, or don't have time to tune your resume.
#### Career Fairs
Low quitting cost, unbelievably high return. A few hours at a career fair can save you dozens attempting to apply online. Go to booths that have people who are actively interviewing people, not just advertising. If they have IPADs, take resumes, or have some software component where you register your attendance at the career fair those are the most valuable booths. If not, there's a chance you'll just be told to apply online and nothing you said to the recruiter will do anything to impact your chances.

Do research beforehand, create a list of companies you want to talk to. Prioritize those that seem to be doing interviews (as mentioned), google them in-depth while you're in line. Come off as curious, open to learn, but knowledgable. Don't try to outsmart the recruiter, be friendly, emphasize passion, experience, and anything unique that helps you stand out.
#### Resume
Low investment. Go to resume workshops, have people review it. For a few hours of investment you can see massive improvements in the kinds of positions you've got access to and how successful you are at applying.
