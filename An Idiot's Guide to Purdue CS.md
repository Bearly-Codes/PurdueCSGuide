## Just Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate level classes, do research, take all the hardest classes, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester you're already behind. In fact you should've come in with AP credits, you should've tested out of CS-180. Plus you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair they _will shoot you, they will take you out back and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good for nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

The imposter syndrome in computer science is real, if you're not feeling it yet look up "Purdue CS guide" and you will. Too many guides do little more than providing overwhelmed students with more things they "should" be doing. They also often fail to provide cost/benefit analysis on potential ways of spending time, instead just assuming that the reader has infinite time to dedicate to whatever activity catches their eye. Because the guides provide few to no methods of actually _freeing_ or better managing time, most students read through a guide and are left only with the lingering anxiety that they either haven't done these things, or can't possibly find the time to get around to them.

Instead this guide will attempt to focus on teaching you how to select, from your varied and overwhelming options, how best to spend your time. In this guide there will be traditional advice, things you _should_ do, but I'll do my best to keep those short and to only the most highly beneficial activities that few people put effort into. Instead my goal is that, having read this guide, you can independently seek out and integrate advice into your schedule without getting overwhelmed.

Don't do more, make the things you're doing do more for you.

With that being said, welcome to
# A Comprehensive Guide to Purdue CS
### The Smartest Guy in the Room
You are, statistically, not a prodigy. If you haven't yet attended Purdue then you're almost certainly overconfident in your own abilities. Put bluntly, it's not that hard to be the smartest guy in the room in high school. Many people come into Purdue expecting this trend to continue, but when you fill a lecture hall with people who are all used to being the smartest guy in the room, _most_ of them are going to be in for a rude awakening. 

Sure, it's possible that you'll be able to continue being the smartest guy in the room in college. One of those guys in the aformentioned room is going to be the smartest. But the smartest guy in the room doesn't _stay_ the smartest guy in the room, not unless there's something wrong with them. They go to a room with smarter people. Elite undergraduates get PHDs, elite PHDs get hired on to elite teams of researchers. It is simply not possible to take for granted that you will be the smartest guy in the room anymore.

That is okay, you need to understand that. It's really, really rough coming in to college, especially if your identity is wrapped up in being the best. You're going to encounter people smarter than anyone you've ever met, people who are terrifyingly good at what they do, and that's going to be exciting, exhillarating, amazing. But it's not exciting yet, right now it's just scary, and that's okay.

#### Stop Being the Smartest Guy in the Room
You should have a good answer to the question "if I'm not the smartest guy in the room, who am I?"

In academic settings this can involve being proud of your passion, specialization, or knowledge about a specific subject. Being the smartest guy in the room is hard and will almost inevitably fail you as a source of self esteem and confidence. Being the guy who knows way, way too much about airplanes? Now that's something that'll stick. If you're the type of person who must derive their self worth from some form of competition or intelliectual superiority, make that worth come from your specialization, not your intelligence.

Additionally, you don't have to derive self worth from these sorts of intellectual pursuits at all. You can be proud of the impact you have on the lives around you, proud of being a good son, daughter, sibling, friend, or partner. You can find worth in the brownies you've perfected over a dozen attempts, the books you've read, the good you've done.

You've got to find something that makes you proud to be you, and it shouldn't be something so transient and brittle as being the smartest guy in the room.
#### The Anatomy of the Smartest Guy in The Room
Remember that many people in CS are desperate to prove their superiority. This can range from not mentioning their embarassing failures and only holding up their successes to embellishing resume items to outright fabrication. People will copy-paste premade online projects to claim as their own, talk up the things that they've done, or make ChatGPT generate their entire LinkedIn and talk about how they endeavoured to enhance cross-team synergy with cutting edge technology to deliver real business results to customers. You're competing with a mirage, many of these people don't really exist. I've met people with stunning LinkedIns that had a profoundly negative impact on my faith in humanity when I had to work with them. Don't beat yourself up because some dude on LinkedIn seems like they're more qualified than you, they might not even exist.

Not only are you unlikely to be the smartest guy in the room, but the actual smartest guy in the room (or the person who appears to be the smartest) is likely to have made life choices you cannot or should not emulate. They're often massively overspecialized into computer science, dedicating vast portions of their life to it. This will make some people happy and others immensely unhappy. Even if you _could_ compete with the computer science prodigies it's likely that you'd enjoy life more if you spent that time becoming a more well rounded person.










### My Perspective
I'm a rising senior in Purdue Computer science. I'm not a prodigy, Zuckerberg hasn't banged on my door to offer me 13 billion dollars to help him build a god and then use it to improve the Instagram reccomendation algorithm, but I've done pretty well. I've got two years of TA experience, gotten As in almost all of my CS classes, and had some success with both internship and job hunting.

 Quite a few student guides have issues. They tend to make the implicit assumption that the reader has the same goal as the writer, and that the environment of Purdue (or whatever college) has stayed the same. In reality, even the best written guide might have a lifetime of  


For that reason, I'll attempt to give you the tools to plan your time well, to figure out what strategies best apply to your goals, and to integrate other people's advice into your plan. 

With all that being said:
## Don't Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate level classes, do research, take all the hardest classes, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester you're already behind. In fact you should've come in with AP credits, you should've tested out of CS-180. Plus you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair they _will shoot you, they will take you out back and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good for nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

The imposter syndrome in computer science is real, if you're not feeling it yet read [this](https://gist.github.com/kartva/30c528420d68869dbcf376cd028fe038). Ask anyone for advice and they'll tell you to do more, do more, do more. Before long you'll feel pulled in a thousand different directions, inadequate compared to your peers, and like you've been behind since the 10th grade because your parents didn't send you to an MIT summer camp.

You are, statistically, not a prodigy. That is okay, you need to understand that. It's really, really rough coming in to college, especially if your identity is wrapped up in being the best. You're going to encounter people smarter than anyone you've ever met, people who are terrifyingly good at what they do, and that's going to be exciting, exhillarating, amazing. But it's not exciting yet, right now it's just scary, and that's okay.

There are some people out there who can genuinely do everything (except get an A in Hardware Security). When you ask them for advice they, like everyone else, will tell you to do more. It's easier for them than it is for you. They've walked in with four years of experience, the early classes were a breeze, they eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff. They are overspecialized into one particular field because they enjoy it (or because they're neurotic) and that works for them. But even if it's possible, most people just aren't that happy being so specialized into their area of study. 

Additionally, remember that many people in CS are desperate to prove their superiority. This can range from not mentioning their embarassing failures and only holding up their successes to embellishing resume items to outright fabrication. People will copy-paste premade online projects to claim as their own, talk up the things that they've done, or make ChatGPT generate their entire LinkedIn and talk about how they endeavoured to enhance cross-team synergy with cutting edge technology to deliver real business results to customers. You're competing with a mirage, many of these people don't really exist. I've met people with stunning LinkedIns that had a profoundly negative impact on my faith in humanity when I had to work with them. Don't beat yourself up beacuse an Instagram model is hotter than you, don't beat yourself up because some dude on LinkedIn seems like they're more qualified than you.

You only have so much energy in the day. If you try to get a 4.0 and join 6 clubs and have personal projects and do hackathons and do research and become a TA and do all the things that everyone keeps telling you to do you'll fail at multiple, hate yourself, hate life, and probably end up worse off. You have a limited amount of time and energy with which to do academic stuff. The advice to "just do more" falls flat on students who are already busy. Few Purdue CS students are spending their days wishing they had more to do.

Don't do more, do better.
### Playing a Role
As I was getting ready for my final round interview I turned to my roommate, laughed, and said "Y'know this interview will probably do more for my future than any individual class this semester". Then it sunk in. This interview was more important than any of my classes _what the hell had I been doing?_ I was walking into the interview with almost no preparation, I'd never devoted time to "studying" interview skills, I'd treated applying for internships like a hobby even though it was the single most important task of the semester.

I made the mistake of playing a role. The role I was playing was "Responsible Student". I played it because it was easy and it made me feel responsible and intelligent. I was fretting over my grades because that's what a Responsible Student does, I was constantly studying because that's what a Responsible Student did, I hadn't put enough effort into my internship hunt because a Responsible Student only cares about his GPA, and internships come distant second in terms of priority.

Do not fall into a role. Don't go to a class you learn nothing from and don't care about because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't overstudy to get an A+ in every class because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't devote your entire life to academics because it's what Responsible Students do. It's tempting to just pick the role of Responsible Student and trust that everything will work out, that by being a responsible enough student you'll get good interneships and a good job. It's also not true.

A role that's far, far worse than "Responsible Student" is "The Best". You were the best in high school, and now you've got to be the best in college. You try to do everything all at once, because you're in competition with everyone. You've got to constantly prove your superiority, constantly take on more responsibility, get an A+ in every class, and if you don't you'll have a nervous breakdown. Similar roles include "Gifted" or "Smart", you're doing things because they're what smart people do, not because they have any relationship at all to any of your goals. Because roles related to being smart or studious hyperfocus on GPA, they often leave people with little time to do extracurriculars, even if the GPA cost of doing an extracurricular would be worth it.

Additionally, roles prevent the use of tools that would otherwise be available and useful. Accepting an F on your transcript because you know you plan on retaking a class, withdrawing from a class that is more difficult this semester than the next, these are not the actions of a Responsible Student and they're certainly not what The Best does, but for you they might be optimal. Maybe skipping class _is_ the responsible thing to do.

Other roles include:
1. The Cool Kid who does things just to fit in.
2. The Genius who must always succeed, so he never tries anything that he might fail at.
3. The Good Person who always puts other people first, even if they're hurting her.
4. The Next Steve Jobs who regards things like entry level jobs as beneath him and must always feel special.
5. The Expert who must always be the most knowledgable about everything and cannot learn from her peers.
6. The Resume Maxxer who only does things if they'll appear on his resume.
7. The Robot, who unthinkingly does all work placed in front of it with no regard to it's goals.

Don't fall into a role. If you do something, do it because it'll help you achieve your goals. If an A+ won't matter to recruiters and your goal is to get a job, then an A+ should always be a pleasant surprise but never something you shoot for. Fall into a role and you're likely to spend your valuable time _extremely_ inefficiently, learn less than you otherwise could've, and miss out on a plethora of opportunities.
### Clarify Your Goals
My goal in college is the following
**Have a memorable and positive college experience whilst setting my future self up as well as possible. This entails finding which parts of CS I most enjoy, learning about CS, getting a good job, and undergoing personal growth and development.**

It's really multiple goals wrapped into one, you'll probably have multiple, and you should write them down. Your goal should be the following:
**Do things I will be glad to have done while in college.**
It's up to you to define what that means. Will your future self be glad you were studious? Probably. Will they be glad that you make lifelong friendships? Probably. Will they be glad you didn't leave your room for 18 days to get an A in some random course that never mattered? Probably not. Will they be glad you went on a 3AM bender and got a DUI? Unlikely. This is also where the toxicity of roles come into play. In 20 years are you going to be glad that you ruthlessly attempted to "beat" everyone else at college and prove you were the smartest guy in the room? Probably not. People on their deathbead don't say "gee I wish I'd styled on some more college students by bragging about my GPA".

Once you've set your goals, break them down into instrumental goals. Keep breaking them down until their actionable. Want a good job? Your goals might involve getting good grades, which involves getting an A in this class, which involves studying. Instrumental goals are intended to help you work towrads your terminal goals (the big ones we defined above), they are good servants but bad masters. Falling into a role involves letting an instrumental goal (I think a good GPA would help me get a good job) take over your life (not preparing for an interview and studying instead). Check that your instrumental goals are still serving your terminal goals. If your instrumental goals are no longer relevant, discard them immediately, regardless of how much time you've invested in them. When instrumental goals take over you start playing a role, don't fall into a role.

Say your instrumental goal is finishing a personal project for your resume. You don't have much spare time for anything else, but you've been keeping your eye out for new opportunities and get offered the ability to do reseach under a professor. If you determine that this research is more valuable than your personal project you should stop the personal project and switch to doing research. The instrumental goal may have been to finish the project, but your terminal goals are better served by failing that instrumental goal. This means that, paradoxically, you'll fail quite a lot more than someone who overfocuses on their instrumental goals. But your graveyard of half complete goals is merely the absence of sunk cost. Some people do switch their instrumental goals far too quickly, but sunk cost is far more common than being overly flighty.
### Aim Big, Cut Aggressively
Try to do more than you think you can in any given semester. This is where "do more" advice comes in handy, you should try to have as wide a spread of options as possible. Write them down, put them on a list. Pick a bunch of the best things to try then cut responsibility if (when) you start getting too stressed. 

The key caveat here is **not to take too much responsibility for which there are high quitting costs**. That means don't accept two TA positions until you know you can handle it, because quitting a TA position incurs a fairly high cost to quit. Qutting cost comes in two forms, the immediate cost (like the cost to quit a gym membership) and lost investment (like the time you lose throwing away a puzzle you've half completed). Quitting anything with a high quitting cost means you've managed your time or planned your semester disastrously wrong.

Activities with a high quitting cost are:
1. Passing courses that are prerequisites, like CS courses in your first 3 semesters.
2. TA/research positions. Quit without a good excuse and you're unlikely to be invited back.
3. Leadership obligations, same as #2.
4. Relationships. Self Explanatory.
5. Club obligations, such as being treasurer or whatever people do in clubs.
6. Classes with a group-project focus. If you take them with friends, you'll lose credibility amongst those friends.
7. Other majors, if you can't reuse the classes you took for them.

Activities with a low quitting cost are:
1. Casually attending club meetings. Go to as many club orientations as you can handle in the first bit of the semester.
2. Casual friend hangouts (movie night or something), especially if you clarify that you might have to skip a few.
3. Gig work.
4. Personal Projects.
5. Classes that aren't essential to your degree plan.
6. Taking classes early to free up space (eg taking 2 CS classes this semester instead of 1).
7. Other majors, if you can reuse the classes you took for them.
8. Personal fitness (though this one is valuable enough that you should be wary of quitting it long-term).

Be aware of the quitting costs of everything in your schedule. Feel free to massively scale up your low-cost responsibilities. Start personal projects, every club that's even slightly interesting, take classes for fun, try to speed up your progression through your degree (as long as you can withdraw with little/no cost if you start getting overwhelmed). But be very careful in scaling up high-cost responsibilities. Try to avoid having more high-cost responsibility than you had total responsibility last semester.

You should do enough that you should have to quit things, fill your schedule with fun and useful padding that has low quitting costs. If you're not quitting things, you're not doing enough. But you should not be quitting anything with a high quitting cost. This means the ideal semester looks like you attending a bunch of clubs, trying out a few personal projects, and then quitting the ones that are least valuable. By trying out a lot of things in the beginning of the semester you'll narrow down the absolute best ways to spend your time, then you can quit what isn't valauble to you.

Consider two worlds. In one you attend a single club, then keep attending it throughout the semester. In another you attend 7 clubs, realize by the second week that you don't have time for that, then cut it down to 3, then 2. You're attending the best of the seven clubs you started with, which guarantees better or equal performance to the first world. You're also attending one more club than you thought you could from the beginning of the semester. I'm avoiding giving direct advice here

The most important part of this is gracefully shedding responsibility to bring yourself into balance. Your goal is not to do **as much as possible** it is to achieve your goals. Your goals are best achieved with a calm, clear mind that has sufficient rest. Don't wait to feel the negative consequences of your responsibilties. Especially do not fall into the role of The Best, because The Best never fails, The Best must succeed everything he does, and he will get an aneurism trying. Remember that it is not failure to shed responsibilities to give yourself more time to rest, to guarantee better performance on instrumental goals that are more useful. It's a key part of the process. More on this in **Don't Become Task Saturated**.

If you're bad at quitting, then you're going to aim too low, too afraid at failing to really try. That, or you'll aim too high and tank your mental health trying to juggle everything. Imagine you've come into Purdue as The Best, and because you're The Best you show up to a club each day, take a ton of difficult classes, and refuse to shoot for anything less than an A in these classes. If you were following my advice, you'd cut some of the club stuff, withdraw from a particularly difficult class, and accept that you might not get all As. You'd end the semester with a decent GPA, good progress on your degree, and a club or two you enjoy. But you're not, you're The Best, so you're going to try to keep doing everything until you burn out so hard that you fail half your classes.
### Maintain Awareness
Imagine you're hiking to a place you've never been with nothing but a map. Getting to your destination is a combination of walking and checking the map. You can't do both at the same time. If you spend all day checking the map (planning, considering posibilities, setting goals) you'll never go anywhere. If you never check the map you'll end up 14 miles deep in bear country. On straight, simple paths (finals week) it might be worth it to just put your head down and walk. But if the path is full of splits and forks it's worth checking the map more often. No balance works for everyone all the time, but everyone needs a balance.

Always keep a little bit left in the tank, always save some effort for checking the map. This is not only good for your mental health, but it's valuable for spotting opportunities. If, instead, you put in maximal effort all the time you'll end up being _task saturated_. When you're task saturated you're so busy doing stuff you have no time to think about, reflect on, or reprioritize the stuff you're doing. You end up being locked in a basic algorithm where you go from one task to the next. You're walking without knowing which direction you're headed.

It's okay for this to happen in the short term, the very short term, like right before an exam or before finals. This is utterly disastrous in the long term. It's terrible for your mental health, it increases the amount of errors your work has, makes it more likely some crucial responsibility will pass by unnoticed, decreases your cognitive performance, and basically forces you into the role of The Robot. The Robot is a terrible role to play. You'll lose situational awareness and fail to spot valuable opportunities and throw out instrumental goals that have gone bad. You'll lose most executive function which can include your ability to gracefully quit responsibilities. Instead you could end up locked into a plane plunging towards the ground, too focused on your instruments to consider ejecting.

Additionally, you'll miss out on the ability to take opportunities you missed because of your tunnel vision. These opportunities could be new friendships, romantic relationships, workshops, an interview practice set up by the CCO. They could be professors you could've emailed looking for research positions, conversations with them you could've had, books you could've read, projects you could've done. The Robot cannot reprioritize, it can do a lot of work, but The Robot will end up wasting most of its energy working on things that are wastes of time.

Leaving just 30 minutes a day free to relax for a bit, poke around emailing professors, checking calendars for events, reviewing the day's work, scheduling tomorrow, and overall considering your life will do more for you than you could imagine. Better yet, set this time up as "miscellaneous task" time. If you can do it in less than 5 minutes, do it during miscellaneous task time. If you can't, spend a minute scheduling a time to actually get it done. Also use this as a time to check in with yourself. Do you feel stressed? Is the world closing in around you? If you feel an unbearable temptation to work, feel as though the world will end if you spare these 30 minutes, you may be well on your way to task saturation.

Use your situational awareness to aggressively steal every potentially useful tactic, bit of advice, and slightly useful method from everyone near you. Constantly keep an eye out for ways to do what you're already doing faster, easier, or better. Look for better ways to spend your time, unexpected opportunitites, new relationships, and interesting events. You should aim to be some horrific chimera of all the smartest people around you, decades of other people's wisdom distilled through your experience into a set of techniques that ensures no effort   is wasted.

Keep your eyes open and your head up. Maintain situational awareness, spot problems or spikes of work that could be on the horizon. Make sure you don't have scheduling conflicts, make sure you're not forgetting anything, make sure you responded to your grandma's texts. Keep an eye out for opportunities that provide an outsized reward compared to their investment. That can be anything from a TA opportunity to a club orientation having extra pizza (I took two full pizzas back to my dorm). Make sure your instrumental goals haven't gone bad, make sure your terminal goals are making you happy. Spending a few minutes a day thinking about if what you're doing is actually working will save you weeks (or months or years) of effort.
### Improve Yourself
Dedicate some time to improving your decision making, goal defining, habit creating, or prioritizing skills. I recommend:
1. Ultralearning
2. Algorithms to Live By
3. The Art of Clear Thinking
4. Atomic Habits

Don't just read them, study them. Use the conceptual studying strategy I mention later on, then use them to make actionable changes in your life. Ideally you should be able to reference them when trying to set up a habit, learn something quickly, or make a good decision. This is akin to learning to read a map; incredibly useful but not in isolation, don't use it as a pure replacement for walking. Don't take them as gospel, some things will work, some things won't.

Speaking of some things working, evaluate how things in your life are working, evaluate your past decisions. When you were wrong and when you fail it can feel like trying to stare into the sun. You'll want to turn away, pretend like it never happened, but in doing so you'll never learn. Failing is never good, but once you've failed you have the opportunity to learn from it, don't give that opportunity up. Build a habit of frequently critiquing yourself and your decisions, but without self-loathing. You shouldn't ruminate negatively for long periods of time, all critiques should be focused either on identifying a problem or solving it, not torturing yourself. That can mean giving yourself space from your failure until you're ready to look at it logically. I recommend writing post-mortems on why you failed, the specific actions you took that lead up to it, how you feel afterwards, and what a world in which you succeeded would've looked like. Note your flaws, be aware of them, plan around them.

Don't put pressure on yourself to immediately change. Learn to be at peace with your flaws, just because you're aware of them doesn't mean they need to be solved immediately. Fixing your flaws is one of many ways you could spend your energy, and if better uses of time exist, then they can be left alone. Be careful about rationalizing yourself out of confronting your flaws, especially if they're hurting others. But it's okay to admit that you spend a bit too much time on your phone, or should be more active, without immediately devoting your life to the gym. Try for slow, gradual improvement. If you have the time or energy it can be worth it to aggressively attempt to fix a flaw (eg going to the gym 6 times a week, quitting nicotine cold turkey) but it's easier than you'd think to just slowly keep things moving in the right direction. Eat a bit better, read a bit more, be a little bit more patient. Keep track of your progress, if you can. It's worth it, I promise.
# An Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass
## This Is It. This Is All There Is.
"I'd like to have a girlfriend but I just don't see how I'd be able to spend any time with her" - Anonymous friend with a 4.0 GPA.

It's a good idea to grind, to focus on the future, to build a better life for yourself. I'm going to spend the rest of this guide talking about how to do just that. But don't wait to start living. Your goal isn't to be the best, or to get the best job, it's to have the best life you can, and you're already living life. This is it. This is all there is. If you don't start living now, you might never start at all.

Free time is not a sin, especially not if you spend it doing things you genuinely enjoy. Brainrotting on TikTok for 14 hours and skipping all your classes is a terrible idea, but forming relationships, doing fun things, feeling the touch of a member of the opposite sex (or same sex, I don't judge), aren't wastes of time if you genuinely value them. Don't put off living, don't feel guilt for living. You need balance if you're going to make it through four years here.

But on the other hand, make sure you're actually doing things you value. It's all too easy to fall into the habit of just doing the easiest, lowest energy activity you have available (Instagram Reels has taken much of my life). If you need some time to rest and relax then sure, that's fine, but try to do more memorable and unique things. If you can't remember what you did in your free time yesterday, you probably didn't spend it very well. Optimizing your time use doesn't apply just to academics, put effort into spending your free time doing things you're proud of having done. That being said, here's a brief **Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass at Purdue**.

### Friends
The first few weeks are critical. You're going to arrive on campus and for a brief, beautiful window _nobody will have friends_. Which means everyone _wants friends_, which means everyone is going to be really, really open to talking to (and hanging out with) new people. This only lasts a little while, once people have found their friend groups (and once you've found yours) they're going to spend a lot less time talking to strangers and a lot more time talking to their established friend groups.

That means you have a limited amount of time to get in at least one friend group before the whole thing becomes a lot more difficult. So spend the first week or two meeting absolutely everyone you can. Say hi, play a board game, join a group for lunch. If you don't like your BGR group, join another one. Even if you're a weird little gremlin who everyone hates, if you play the numbers game enough you're almost certain to find a group of people who at least tolerate you. You should not, and I mean ABSOLUTELY NOT just hang out with the same two people you knew from high school. Push past that social anxiety, remember they're just as afraid of you then you are of them!

Because classes are nonexistant and everyone is desperate to find someone to hang out with, you're going to have lots of opportunities to make and maintain friendships. But you can't stay friends with everyone. As classes get harder people will begin to withdraw. They'll stop hanging out with as many people and retreat to a smaller circle. This is when the core of your friend group will form. Try to keep everyone as an acquaintance (if even a distant one), but pick the best people you've met and put in an effort to keep hanging out with them, even while you're busy.

When choosing friends, pick people who you'd like to become more similar to. If someone told you that you were a lot like your friends, and that made you feel happy, then you're probably in good company. Don't just hang out with the first person to tolerate your presence, find people who you really vibe with. Also, if you have smart friends they'll help you in classes. If you don't have smart friends, then you might be the smart friend, and you'll have to help people in classes.

Beyond all that, here are a few random tips to start conversations with strangers:
1. They will not remember you unless you screw up monumentally. Like, vomit in front of them or something. People do not have enough mental bandwidth to judge strangers.
2. Use something you have in common. If they're strangers, then use something visible on their person ("oh wow is that a ___ shirt?") or something in your current environment ("Does the line always get this long?"). If they brush you off, don't force it, don't try again, just move on.
3. Don't monologue. Most people like to talk, let them. If they're talking a lot chances are they're really enjoying the conversation. Or maybe you got a fact wrong and they're correcting you. Either way they're engaged!
4. Don't aggressively steer conversations to your special interests. If they're interested, they'll bite. If they steer the conversation away, they don't want to hear about Sonic the Hedgehog.
5. Continuation of #2, try to build off shared emotions. Like you both absolutely bombing an exam.
6. Don't try to awkwardly join discussions between friends. If you're a gregarious enough person you might be able to pull it off but let's be honest, you're a Purdue CS student.

Here's how to turn people you're chatting with into friends
1. Ideally meet the same people multiple times. If you're friendly each time, it makes the following steps easier.
2. Walk with them wherever they're going (as long as it's the direction you're headed, or not too far out of your way). **Do not follow people if they don't want you there, don't be creepy**.
3. Try to meet outside of class or whatever environment you see them in. This can be as blunt as asking someone you've just met to help you study, or asking the person you're walking with if they want to get lunch together.
4. Try to make a routine. It's kinda difficult to keep asking someone to hang out. It's much easier if you know you're both going to meet on Friday to study, because that's what you do every Friday.
5. Be classy about rejection. If someone keeps having excuses for not hanging with you, just say "Sucks that you're so busy, let me know when you're free" and move on.
### Roommate(s)
Ideally with the advice above you'll have found a group of friends. From there you need to pick a roommate, and you'll need to do this earlier on in the year than you'd think. If you plan on living off campus, you'll be sharing a kitchen and a lease with them. If you're on campus, then you'll be sharing a room. This can either lead to an uncomfortable cold war with what used to be a friend, or the solidification of your already rock solid friendship bond into a friendship diamond that can transcend any mortal struggle.

Your roommate should, ideally, also be someone you respect and like a great deal. You should want to be more like them, because after a year in the same room you'll start to mind-meld. If your roommate is a workaholic, seeing them do work will encourage you. If they're a socialite, they'll help get you out of the dorm. If they're smart, they can help with classes. If they're an alcoholic... well...

A few red flags that are fine in friends but bad in roommates:
1. Never leaves the room. It means they'll never leave _your_ room. If that's a problem, pick someone who touches grass more.
2. Always has crazy stuff happen to them. If you're their friend, you get a front row seat. If you're their roommate, you might become involved in their drama.
3. Always in fights. They'll start fighting with you.
4. Crazy party animal. If they vomit, you might have to clean it up.
5. Snores.
6. Is a romantic interest. Don't, not until you've known them for longer than a few months.
7. Always has their romantic interest two feet away. That romantic interest will be an honorary roommate.
8. Is someone who constantly needs help or is struggling. You're likely to get wrapped up in their problems.

As a coincidence, these all apply to romantic partners too.
### Romance
There's a lot of bad advice floating around out there, I'll keep this short so as not to add to it.

#### Asking Someone Out
Only ask twice. If you ask someone if they want to have lunch some time and they say "ah sorry I'm busy today" propose an alternative time, if they seem unsure about that, move on. Let them know you're open if they ever want to schedule anything, but don't push the issue. A lot of people will, if they're nervous, reject you by making excuses or saying they're busy. Take this as the rejection it is, provide them the offer to follow up with you later if they want to (or if they truly didn't mean it as a rejection). If someone has rejected you once, they're probably going to reject you again, don't keep pursuing them. It wastes your time and makes them feel uncomfortable

Don't put them under pressure. Don't mention that you've pined for them for years, that you'll be crushed if they reject you, or that they're what makes your life worth living. Even if that's true, don't mention it. Unless you're putting the moves on a stranger, they've probably already decided if they like you romantically or not. Your goal isn't to get them to say yes, it's to _figure out if they like you_. If they don't it's best to fail fast, rather than have them break up with you after two months because you pressured them into something.

Don't pursue people who don't like you. Not only is this almost never going to work, but it tends to be a terrible experience for the person you're actually pursuing. If someone says no, they said no. Don't stay friends with them in hopes they'll suddenly fall in love. They're probably not going to change their mind, just move on. This tends to happen with people who've talked to only one or two members of their preferred sex and tunnel vision hard. Trust me, I know it feels like they're the only thing that could complete you, but it's probably just your lizard brain white-knuckling what it feels is the only opportunity for you to reproduce. There are a lot of people at Purdue, you'll find someone else.

#### Handling a Relationship
The absolute most important thing to do is match their energy (somewhat). You should be on the same page regarding the relationship, and while you can attempt to make the relationship more serious, more committed, more sexual, or in some way different than it is now, you have to do it incrementally. Some people are passionate and fall deeply in love very quickly. In this case the relationship might get very close and very serious very quickly. This isn't inherently bad, two people who get engaged six weeks after starting to date might be perfectly happy with each other. But only if they _both_ want the relationship to be like that.

This is most obvious in the sexual sense. You don't have to stick to an exact order of progression, but if you've never kissed it's a bad idea to propose sleeping together. You shouldn't attempt to make the relationship radically more sexual than it is all at once, instead do it in stages. Move the relationship a little bit in the direction you'd like it, stop, assess to make sure they're comfortable and on board with everything, if they are move it a little more. Be very open to them saying no, or saying yes but being uncomfortable with it (which you should take as a no). This applies to every other aspect of the relationship.

If you've never given each other gifts, start out with a small trinket, something to put on their desk, or some food before buying them expensive jewelry. If you've never lived together, stay the night a few times before moving in. Say "I love you" before "I want to marry you". A surefire way to blow up a relationship is moving _way_ too fast when they're not comfortable.

Make sure they're _actually_ happy with how things are progressing. Your goal isn't to "get your way", you don't want someone to say "I love you" because they felt forced to. It's to slowly move to a closer and more serious relationship at a pace both people are happy with. Not to unilaterally declare the relationship is more serious than it is, nor to force your partner through an incrementally increasing series of commitments.

If your partner is unwilling to move the relationship in the kind of way you'd like, this is a good reason to break up. If you want a more committed relationship and they're unwilling to provide that, you can break things off and say you're incompatible. You should not use threats of a breakup to move the relationship (again your goal isn't to get your way), but you're not obligated to stay in a relationship that isn't what you want. Nor do you have the right to unilaterally move the relationship to where you'd like it to be.
# The Academics
### Take Additional Classes
These classes can be in service of a major, minor, helping you graduate faster, or just 'cause they're cool. The cost of quitting is really up to you here. If you plan things right and make sure you have easy off-ramps of transitioning majors into minors or reusing half completed minors to meet other requirements you might have no quitting cost at all. 

The best scenarios are ones in which you only need a few additional classes to get a major or minor. With the right CS classes, you only need one additional class to get a math minor. If you drop this class, you're not really losing much. All the other classes you took in service to your math minor are still helping you graduate. But if you take a bunch of classes for a major in Anthropology or something, then quit halfway through, it might end up being a massive waste of time.

It's worthwhile to schedule classes as though you're aiming for a minor, second major, or additional track(s). This results in taking more classes earlier, but even if you quit you'll still be able to use the classes you took. When in doubt, take classes that apply to multiple goals first. Delay classes that apply to only one major or track as long as possible. If you start getting overwhelmed, dropping the minor is just a matter of changing your future plans and rescheduling a few classes.

Additional classes and majors are large time investments. Make sure that they're genuinely worthwhile. Don't take a minor because you can, take it because you've determined that it's the most efficient use of your time. Talk to professors, company reps, upperclassmen, and industry workers to ask them how valuable getting another major might be. Taking those extra classes could be really useful, or they could be a massive waste of time. Don't get a second major just to have a second major.
#### My Study Methods
Classes often contain three things you need to study:
1. Procedural knowledge. How to do something. Like math.
2. Conceptual knowledge. What something is, does, or how it works. Like history.
3. Factual knowledge. Dates, names, numbers, definitions.

All of calculus is procedural knowledge. Linear is procedural and a bit of conceptual. CS-180 changed since I took it, but it's mostly procedural with some factual mixed in. CS-240, CS-250, CS252 were a mixture of procedural, conceptual, and factual. CS-251 and CS-182 were procedural. If a class's exams involve doing some task with an objective right or wrong (FRQ coding, solving math problems), they're probably procedural. If they involve answering questions with multiple sentences or applying knowledge they're conceptual. If they're multiple choice (excluding math), fill in the blank, or require remembering specific numbers or words in association to something, they're factual.

Study procedural knowledge by performing the procedures you'll be tested on as often as possible, in as similar an environment to the test as possible. That means do study guides, write practice code problems for 240, 250, and 252, and do them repeatedly. Grade your work, if you did it wrong re-do it correctly. Most students will come in with only a conceptual, theoretical understanding. Practicing the procedure will make you far faster and much more correct.

Study conceptual knowledge by writing free response questions and then try to write your entire understanding of a concept as fast as possible. Don't use the internet or outside help. After you're done, use the internet to edit your initial writing to make it better. Learning about paging? Write everything you know about paging down on a sheet of paper (or a document), then go to the slides to add all the facts you missed.

Study factual knowledge with flashcards. Go through the class's material and note everything that could be tested on. Put them in quizlet. Don't study this way if you don't need to. It can be tempting to study for factual knowledge even if the course really doesn't require it. If your first midterm didn't require you to memorize any specific definitions or numbers it might be more worthwhile to focus on conceptual knowledge instead.

Use spaced repetition. Review things multiple times, spread out over a long period of time. If you actually want to remember stuff long-term that is. I'm an elite tier crammer and if I don't care about a class I can fit a massive amount of information into my brain for 12 hours, then forget everything after. I'm not sure how common this skill is, so it's best to use spaced repetition when you have the time for it, or if you want to actually remember the content of a class.

Do not mindlessly re-read notes except as a quick refresher before an exam. If you're not rephrasing it, remembering it, or learning it for the first time, you're probably not learning at all.
### Use TAs
I'm biased, obviously, but we do occasionally know what we're talking about. If you're stuck on something you could spend three hours figuring it out. Or you could show up to an office hour (or another lab session), ask a TA, and watch them solve it in five minutes.

Please at least attempt to solve it beforehand. Try to add a bunch of print statements and give the TAs information about what you've tried and what hasn't worked, too. It'll help us fix your issue far faster than if you just plop a computer down in front of us and go "it doesn't work". TAs become absolutely essential in CS250 and CS252 (what a coincidence... the classes I TA).

Also, ask them for advice. They've taken the class and done well enough that they were able to TA it. Some of them will have succeeded due to innate ability or more motivation, but they might also have some strategies that could help you out. Also, if you're friendly with your TAs they'll be more understanding if you want to leave lab early. But don't be too friendly, don't date your TA. TAs, don't date your students.
### Academic Dishonesty
Cheating is difficult to catch (if done well) and incredibly rewarding in the short term. Cheating could be the best use of your time, it could potentially serve your goals. But most often cheating is done out of desperation due to poor time management. Sloppy cheating is never the best use of your time, it is never optimal. It's more a signal that you've got too much on your plate, or that you lack time management skills. Every semester we tell people in CS-180 that they'll get caught if they copy-paste someone else's work. Every semester a horde of idiots does just that. Rather than cheating I recomend the tactics I mention in **Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)**.

When talking about the risks of cheating, most obviously you could get caught. Purdue will not mess around, and you probably can't BS them once they're on to you. I know people who run academic integrity for the courses you'll probably be taking. It's difficult to tell who's using ChatGPT, but we've had decades of experience catching students who copy paste. If you do cheat, there's an automatic 0 on the assignment (duh). You're also likely to get your overall letter grade lowered (eg if you would have gotten an A now you get a B+ or a B) and could end up with your cheating recorded by the Office of the Dean of Students.

Another risk is that you don't learn class content. That's not too fine if it's some random class you're taking to meet an arbitrary graduation requirement. That's absolutely not fine if you're taking any of the following classes:
1. CS-180
2. CS-182
3. CS-240
4. CS-250
5. CS-251 if you plan on doing anything related to algorithms (eg CS-381)
6. CS-252 if you plan on doing anything related to systems (eg CS-354)
7. Calc 1 and Calc 2

Failing to understand the concepts presented in these classes will directly impact your performance in later classes. Even within a single class, failing to understand prerequisite material can result in you needing to cheat later on to maintain your performance. Professors can stay silent while they build an academic dishonesty case against you, and prolific enough cheating can incur serious penalties up to and including expulsion. If you have a history of cheating in Calc-1 and then attempt to cheat your way through Calc-2 and get caught you'll either have to risk further penalty by continuing to cheat or teach yourself all the concepts you missed in Calc-1 so you can complete the course authentically.

Never, ever cheat in CS-180. Not only do you run the risk of getting a permenant mark on your record for cheating in the easiest CS class in your easiest semester, but you run the risk of never learning core skills that you'll use for the rest of your degree (and career). If you cheat once or twice that is a strong sign that you struggle with time management, motivation, or some other core capability that almost guarantees your failure unless you fix it before classes get harder. CS-180 is a course that teaches you how to program by making you do lots of programming, it may feel fairly easy and full of repetition but the repetition will increase your speed, decrease the quantity of bugs you produce, and make the entire rest of college easier. Not to mention your first semester is crucial to building good habits that'll stick with you for the rest of college. That's assuming you don't get caught and still pass CS-180 too, which is not guaranteed if you cheat.

If you're seriously considering frequent cheating in CS-180 I'd advise dropping out or changing majors. The only scenario in which I could see that kind of cheating in CS-180 being a good idea is if those options weren't available to you (unsafe home environment and parents who would only pay for a CS degree, for example). Other than that, cheating is CS-180 is monumentally stupid. Not only are you cheating in a class that teaches core competencies, but you're likely too ignorant to understand what kind of information it's okay to skip out on learning and what's absolutely critical.

In general I'd say it's okay to:
1. Check answers with friends
2. Describe and clarify the requirements of a problem (eg clarifying a bad handout or something)
3. Describe how you solved a problem in English
4. Solve a problem/algorithm in English together, then go off and write your own code.

You start getting into cheating territory when you:
1. Edit someone else's code directly.
2. Tell someone the exact code you used.
3. Copy paste. Don't copy paste. You'll get caught, and it's stupid. Don't.
### Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)
You don't need to learn everything in every class at college. Most of the classes are pretty useful, that communications class is probably going to be pretty valuable in your future. But often times random gen-eds and high level classes in areas that don't interest you are going to be chock full of stuff you really don't care about. In those courses, your goal should be to get a good grade with minimal effort.

Now it's worth clarifying that you are human, and your judgement is flawed. You could catastrophically misjudge a course, decide that some topic is BS before realizing it's going to keep cropping up over and over again (cough concurrency cough), or fail to understand how a course might not help your academic understanding of computer science, but could be pretty useful in a job or your personal life. So min-maxxing for grades is a tool that should be used sparingly, and never on CS courses. But you can strategically dial back your effort into a course, even a CS course, that's not your focus in order to put more time into things that are.

However in the online gen-ed you're only taking for the credits? You should put in enough effort to get an A and no more, not unless that effort will help you achieve any of your goals. People reading this might be in the habit of thinking of themselves as hard working, studious people. Meaning they're unlikely to skip class or cram for exams. But it can absolutely be a good decision to skip classes and cram for exams. I've taken a handful of courses where I've gotten an A or A+ without ever going to class, did all the homework in the first week of the semester, and crammed the night before an exam.

The key is to decide what you want out of a course. In some cases that can only be the grade, for instance if you were taking classes for a language requirement but weren't interested in learning another language. In most CS classes that's going to be some mixture of grades and understanding. In the classes that pertain to the field you're most passionate about the scale will tilt much more towards genuine understanding.

If you want to understand the topics in a course:
1. Follow along with it as it's taught, don't learn the concepts before the exam.
2. Attend class.
3. Review what you learned in class afterwards.
4. Review frequently, even if only for a small amount of time.
5. Rephrase the knowledge, try to distill key concepts, write out everything you know about the subject, talk about it to your friends.

If you want to get a good grade in a course (with minimal time investment):
1. Skip classes if you can learn on your own faster.
2. Do as much homework as early as possible in the semester so it's out of the way.
3. Ignore class content until you get near an exam, then cram for the exam.
4. Put minimal effort into homework and assignments.

But most importantly if you can, avoid taking the class entirely. Use CLEP, test out, or take it at a community college. Don't devote more time than is necessary to a course that doesn't deserve it. I was able to do 21 college credits in 5 weeks with CLEP. This ties back into maintaining situational awareness. It's easy to follow the beaten path of taking classes at Purdue, but with a little bit of extra effort hunting for opportunities you can make your life way easier.

This comes with the caveat that this is risky. Until you're used to college it's not worth it to skip every class and learn content right before the exam. In fact, for many people that might be a totally invalid strategy. Additionally, like I said, our judgement is flawed. Especially when we're new to college. Early on attempting extreme time saving measures (aside from testing out of gen-eds) can hurt your grades or prevent you from learning things you really should've learned.

I'd recommend starting slow, dial back the effort in courses you don't need to much understanding in. If you're still getting good grades and doing well on exams feel free to dial back the effort even more. This comes with the inherent risk of a dark horse final coming out of nowhere and being far more difficult than the rest of the course. But running the risk of getting a B in a course you don't really care about can be worthwhile if it means getting an A in a course you do care about, or if you're doing more valuable things with your time. Understand that this comes with a risk, and should be done **carefully**, **slowly** and ideally _very little or not at all in your first semester_.

In STAT-511, a statistics course that I was required to take, I didn't care too much about the class. The concepts were easy enough to review on their own, most I'd already learned in AP Stats. I'd show up to class (attendance was required), put my earbuds in, and do other work. I'd zoom through the homeworks looking to complete them with minimal effort, then right before the exam I studied a ton. I got a 100%. Then I did the exact same thing for the final, which ended up being almost an entirely different format to the first exam and my overall grade got knocked down to a B+. If I'd had a better understanding of the course I could've gotten an A. But the time I saved in blitzing through this course, along with all the other ones that I'd gotten As in, was worth it for me. But this strategy is also uniquely well suited to me, I'm very good at teaching myself. It might be (probably is) terribly suited for you. Be very very careful when using it, never use it in a class you can't easily retake.
### White Whales
White Whales are the term I have for classes in which it is incredibly difficult to get an A, but comparatively easy to recieve a B or a C. Perfectionists will tank their mental health and put all their other grades at risk in order to achieve an A in a White Whale. This is an especially bad idea if the course is one they're not well suited for, isn't particularly useful for their future, or is irrelevant to their goals.

If you think it's achievable, then feel free to hunt that White Whale. But remember that your effort should be used in the most efficient manner possible. If your mental health is destroyed, you couldn't dedicate any time to your friends, job search, hobbies, or personal projects, and you run the risk of your grades slipping in other classes, that A really isn't worth it. I naturally tunnel vision, and I'm a bit of a perfectionist (when it comes to courses I care about). Sometimes that motivation can be great. But other times it makes me ignore things that would be better uses of my time in favor of chasing an A that's going to have an insignificant impact on my GPA.

It's also worth noting that you could be dumping a lot of effort into a strategy that's just not working. What might at first seem to be a white whale could be an easy A once you learn how to study for it. I took a history course that graded us off of in class essays. I could easily get Bs on the essays, but it was a struggle to get As. I studied and memorized a huge amount, and my grades climbed into the B+ range. But I was putting more effort into this history class than most of my CS classes. Then I figured out (stole) a better studying method, writing practice essays. Suddenly, with less effort, I was getting As.
## The Job Hunt
While academics tends to dominate the minds of students, the hunt for internships (and jobs) is equally as important. Not so much your freshman year (though you should turn up to a few career fairs to get used to it) but sophomore year and your internships can matter as much as (or more than) your grades.

Despite this, students tend to massively under-invest in finding an internship. This makes it comparatively easy to stand out in this regard as compared to something like, say, standing out in terms of GPA. Additionally, all of this stuff tends to be really low investment. Nobody's going to care if you decide that you can't show up at a career fair, or don't have time to tune your resume.

If you were willing to get Bs in a few hard classes instead of As (or Cs instead of Bs) it might lower your GPA by 0.1 or 0.2. But if you dedicate the massive amount of time you save to aggressively hunting for jobs or summer opportunities you're almost guaranteed to come out on top.

In your freshman year spend time asking people at career fairs what they look for on resumes, getting advice from upperclassmen and professors (though keep in mind that professors have been out of the market for a while), and make use of the many Purdue resources to help you get a job. Practice mock interviews, learn STAR questions, and it'll be easy to stand out. Most students put far, far too little effort into their internship hunt.
### Career Fairs
A few hours at a career fair can save you dozens attempting to apply online. Go to booths that have people who are actively interviewing people, not just advertising. If they have IPADs, take resumes, or have some software component where you register your attendance at the career fair those are the most valuable booths. If not, there's a chance you'll just be told to apply online and nothing you said to the recruiter will do anything to impact your chances.

Do research beforehand, create a list of companies you want to talk to. Prioritize those that seem to be doing interviews (as mentioned), google them in-depth while you're in line. Come off as curious, open to learn, but knowledgable. Don't try to outsmart the recruiter, be friendly, emphasize passion, experience, and anything unique that helps you stand out.
### Resume
Go to resume workshops, have people review it. For a few hours of investment you can see massive improvements in the kinds of positions you've got access to and how successful you are at applying. I don't know how to write a good resume, but other people do, you should seek their feedback constantly.
### Applying Online
Cover letters should be short, if you write them at all. They should be of the format "Hey, I'm __ from Purdue University, I think my skills in X and Y and my personal project Z would make me a good fit for this position." Don't use ChatGPT, don't glaze the company, just explain why you're a good fit for that position.

Apply early, apply to far more companies than you think you should. Aim for over 100 applications. Start applying almost as soon as school starts. This is less relevant in your freshman year. If you want a freshman internship, consider having rich parents with valauble industry connections.
### Do Your Own Research
Figure out what things have a disproportionate reward to effort ratio and do them. As I mentioned, practice interviews and STAR questions, go to career fairs, get your resume checked. But keep an eye out for opportunities similar to these, ask upperclassmen what they think is most valuable to do, always keep your head up.

When you're too busy you become task saturated. You can't keep an eye out for new opportunities that might be a better use of your time, because you're ultra-focused on completing the stuff you've already got to get done. This is another reason why it's a good idea to cut aggressively. Sure you could complete all those classes, but in doing so you might miss out on a resume workshop, never follow up with that girl who gave you her number, or never get around to emailing professors for research opportunities. Set aside dedicated time, especially at the beginning of each semester, to hunt for opportunities.

Don't limit yourself to the list, techniques, and tools on this list. Constantly evaluate what you're doing and if there's a more efficient way to achieve your goals.
## Extracurriculars
The quality of clubs, relevance of personal projects, and availability and benefit of things like research are going to be constantly shifting. You should
