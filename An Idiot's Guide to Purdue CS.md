# An Idiot's Guide to Purdue CS



### My Perspective
I'm a rising senior in Purdue Computer science. I'm not a prodigy, Zuckerberg hasn't banged on my door to offer me 13 billion dollars to help him build a god and then use it to improve the Instagram reccomendation algorithm, but I've done pretty well. I've got two years of TA experience, gotten As in almost all of my CS classes, and had some success with both internship and job hunting.

The following is my advice to incoming freshmen (and students at every level, really). It's probably most applicable to Computer Science students who are similar to me, so don't be afraid to pick and choose the advice you follow. Some of it may work for you, some of it may not. We're all different people and the advice that guides one person to a 4.0 might send another into a mental hospital. With all that being said:
## Don't Do More
You've got to go to clubs, take graduate level classes, do research, take all the hardest classes, and maintain a 4.0. Don't forget personal projects, you didn't forget personal projects did you? If you don't have projects by the end of your first semester you're already behind. In fact you should've come in with AP credits, you should've tested out of CS-180. Plus you've got to do a minor, and a second major, and if you haven't done a hackathon when they talk to you at the career fair they _will shoot you, they will take you out back and they will shoot you because you're a lazy, good for nothing waste of space_.

**Jesus Christ. Stop.**

The imposter syndrome in computer science is real, if you're not feeling it yet read [this](https://gist.github.com/kartva/30c528420d68869dbcf376cd028fe038). Ask anyone for advice and they'll tell you to do more, do more, do more. Before long you'll feel pulled in a thousand different directions, inadequate compared to your peers, and like you've been behind since the 10th grade because your parents didn't send you to an MIT summer camp.

You are, statistically, not a prodigy. That is okay, you need to understand that. It's really, really rough coming in to college, especially if your identity is wrapped up in being the best. You're going to encounter people smarter than you've ever met, people who are terrifyingly good at what they do, and that's going to be exciting, exhillarating, amazing. But it's not exciting yet, right now it's just scary, and that's okay.

There are some people out there who can genuinely do everything (except get an A in Hardware Security). When you ask them for advice they, like everyone else, will tell you to do more. It's easy for them, they're just that good. They've walked in with four years of experience, the early classes were a breeze, they eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff. You cannot and should not emulate them.

You only have so much energy in the day. If you try to get a 4.0 and join a club and have personal projects and do hackathons and do research and become a TA and do all the things that everyone keeps telling you to do you'll fail at multiple, hate yourself, hate life, and probably end up worse off. You have a limited amount of time and energy with which to do academic stuff. The solution isn't to do more, it's to make the effort you're already putting in do more for you.

Don't do more, do better.
### Playing a Role
As I was getting ready for my final round interview I turned to my roommate, laughed, and said "Y'know this interview will probably do more for my future than any individual class this semester". Then it sunk in. This interview was more important than any of my classes _what the hell had I been doing?_ I was walking into the interview with almost no preparation, I'd never devoted time to "studying" interview skills, I'd treated applying for internships like a hobby even though it was the single most important task of the semester.

I made the mistake of playing a role. The role I was playing was "responsible student". I played it because it was easy and it made me feel responsible and intelligent. I was fretting over my grades because that's what a Responsible Student does, I was constantly studying because that's what a Responsible Student did, I hadn't put enough effort into my internship hunt because a Responsible Student only cares about his GPA, and internships come distant second in terms of priority.

Do not fall into a role. Don't go to a class you learn nothing from and don't care about because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't overstudy to get an A+ in every class because it's what Responsible Students do. Don't devote your entire life to academics because it's what Responsible Students do. It's tempting to just pick the role of "responsible student" and trust that everything will work out, that by being a responsible enough student you'll get good interneships and a good job. It's also not true.

A role that's far, far worse than "Responsible Student" is "The Best". You were the best in high school, and now you've got to be the best in college. You try to do everything all at once, because you're in competition with everyone. You've got to constantly prove your superiority, constantly take on more responsibility, get an A+ in every class, and if you don't you'll have a nervous breakdown. Similar roles include "Gifted" or "Smart", you're doing things because they're what smart people do, not because they have any relationship at all to any of your goals. Additionally, because roles related to being smart or studious hyperfocus on GPA, they often leave people with little time to do extracurriculars, even if the GPA cost of doing an extracurricular would be worth it.


Don't fall into a role. If you do something, do it because it'll help you achieve your goals. If an A+ won't matter to recruiters and your goal is to get a job, then an A+ should always be a pleasant surprise but never something you shoot for. Fall into a role and you're likely to spend your valuable time _extremely_ inefficiently, learn less than you otherwise could've, and miss out on a plethora of opportunities.
### Clarify Your Goals
My goal in college is the following
**Have a memorable and positive college experience whilst setting my future self up as well as possible. This entails finding which parts of CS I most enjoy, learning about CS, getting a good job, and undergoing personal growth and development.**

It's really multiple goals wrapped into one, you'll probably have multiple, and you should write them down. Your goal should be the following:
**Do things I will be glad to have done while in college.**
It's up to you to define what that means. Will your future self be glad you were studious? Probably. Will they be glad that you make lifelong friendships? Probably. Will they be glad you didn't leave your room for 18 days to get an A in some random course that never mattered? Probably not. Will they be glad you went on a 3AM bender and got a DUI? Unlikely.

Once you've set your goals, break them down into instrumental goals. Want a good job? Your goals might involve getting a good grade, building a good resume, and getting to a few career fairs. Instrumental goals are intended to help you work towrads your terminal goals (the big ones we defined above), they are good servants but bad masters. Falling into a role involves letting an instrumental goal (I think a good GPA would help me get a good job) take over your life (not preparing for an interview and studying instead). Check that your instrumental goals are still serving your terminal goals. If your instrumental goals are no longer relevant, discard them immediately, regardless of how much time you've invested in them.

Say your instrumental goal is finishing a personal project for your resume. You don't have much spare time for anything else, but you've been keeping your eye out for new opportunities and get offered the ability to do reseach under a professor. If you determine that this research is more valuable than your personal project you should stop the personal project and switch to doing research. The instrumental goal may have been to finish the project, but your terminal goals are better served by failing that instrumental goal. This means that, paradoxically, you'll fail quite a lot more than someone who overfocuses on their instrumental goals. But your graveyard of half complete goals is merely the absence of sunk cost. Some people do switch their instrumental goals far too quickly, but sunk cost is far more common than being overly flighty.
# An Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass
## This Is It. This Is All There Is.
"I'd like to have a girlfriend but I just don't see how I'd be able to spend any time with her" - Anonymous friend with a 4.0 GPA.

It's a good idea to grind, to focus on the future, to build a better life for yourself. I'm going to spend the rest of this guide talking about how to do just that. But don't wait to start living. Your goal isn't to be the best, or to get the best job, it's to have the best life, and you're already living life. This is it. This is all there is. If you don't start living now, you might never start at all.

Free time is not a sin, especially not if you spend it doing things you genuinely enjoy. Brainrotting on TikTok for 14 hours and skipping all your classes is a terrible idea, but forming relationships, doing fun things, feeling the touch of a member of the opposite sex (or same sex, I don't judge), aren't wastes of time if you genuinely value them. Don't put off living, don't feel guilt for living. You need balance if you're going to make it through four years here.

But on the other hand, make sure you're actually doing things you value. It's all too easy to fall into the habit of just doing the easiest, lowest energy activity you have available (Instagram Reels has taken much of my life). If you need some time to rest and relax then sure, that's fine, but try to do more memorable and unique things. If you can't remember what you did in your free time yesterday, you probably didn't spend it very well. Optimizing your time use doesn't apply just to academics, put effort into spending your free time doing things you're proud of having done. That being said, here's a brief **Idiot's Guide to Touching Grass at Purdue**.

### Friends
The first few weeks are critical. You're going to arrive on campus and for a brief, beautiful window _nobody will have friends_. Which means everyone _wants friends_, which means everyone is going to be really, really open to talking to (and hanging out with) new people. This only lasts a little while, once people have found their friend groups (and once you've found yours) they're going to spend a lot less time talking to strangers and a lot more time talking to their established friend groups.

That means you have a limited amount of time to get in at least one friend group before the whole thing becomes a lot more difficult. So spend the first week or two meeting absolutely everyone you can. Say hi, play a board game, join a group for lunch. If you don't like your BGR group, join another one. Even if you're a weird little gremlin who everyone hates, if you play the numbers game enough you're almost certain to find a group of people who at least tolerate you. You should not, and I mean ABSOLUTELY NOT just hang out with the same two people you knew from high school. Push past that social anxiety, remember they're just as afraid of you then you are of them!

Because classes are nonexistant and everyone is desperate to find someone to hang out with, you're going to have lots of opportunities to make and maintain friendships. But you can't stay friends with everyone. As classes get harder people will begin to withdraw. They'll stop hanging out with as many people and retreat to a smaller circle. This is when the core of your friend group will form. Try to keep everyone as an acquaintance (if even a distant one), but pick the best people you've met and put in an effort to keep hanging out with them, even while you're busy.

When choosing friends, pick people who you'd like to become more similar to. If someone told you that you were a lot like your friends, and that made you feel happy, then you're probably in good company. Don't just hang out with the first person to tolerate your presence, find people who you really vibe with. Also, if you have smart friends they'll help you in classes. If you don't have smart friends, then you might be the smart friend, and you'll have to help people in classes.

Beyond all that, here are a few random tips to start conversations with strangers:
1. They will not remember you unless you screw up monumentally. Like, vomit in front of them or something. People do not have enough mental bandwidth to judge strangers.
2. Use something you have in common. If they're strangers, then use something visible on their person ("oh wow is that a ___ shirt?") or something in your current environment ("Does the line always get this long?"). If they brush you off, don't force it, don't try again, just move on.
3. Don't monologue. Most people like to talk, let them. If they're talking a lot chances are they're really enjoying the conversation. Or maybe you got a fact wrong and they're correcting you. Either way they're engaged!
4. Don't aggressively steer conversations to your special interests. If they're interested, they'll bite. If they steer the conversation away, they don't want to hear about Sonic the Hedgehog.
5. Continuation of #2, try to build off shared emotions. Like you both absolutely bombing an exam.
6. Don't try to awkwardly join discussions between friends. If you're a gregarious enough person you might be able to pull it off but let's be honest, you're a Purdue CS student.

Here's how to turn people you're chatting with into friends
1. Ideally meet the same people multiple times. If you're friendly each time, it makes the following steps easier.
2. Walk with them wherever they're going (as long as it's the direction you're headed, or not too far out of your way). **Do not follow people if they don't want you there, don't be creepy**.
3. Try to meet outside of class or whatever environment you see them in. This can be as blunt as asking someone you've just met to help you study, or asking the person you're walking with if they want to get lunch together.
4. Try to make a routine. It's kinda difficult to keep asking someone to hang out. It's much easier if you know you're both going to meet on Friday to study, because that's what you do every Friday.
### Roommate(s)
Ideally with the advice above you'll have found a group of friends. From there you need to pick a roommate, and you'll need to do this earlier on in the year than you'd think. If you plan on living off campus, you'll be sharing a kitchen and a lease with them. If you're on campus, then you'll be sharing a room. This can either lead to an uncomfortable cold war with what used to be a friend, or the solidification of your already rock solid friendship into a friendship diamond that can transcend any mortal struggle.

Your roommate should, ideally, also be someone you respect and like a great deal. You should want to be more like them, because after a year in the same room you'll start to mind-meld. If your roommate is a workaholic, seeing them do work will encourage you. If they're a socialite, they'll help get you out of the dorm. If they're smart, they can help with classes. If they're an alcoholic... well...

A few red flags that are fine in friends but bad in roommates:
1. Never leaves the room. It means they'll never leave _your_ room. If that's a problem, pick someone who touches grass more.
2. Always has crazy stuff happen to them. If you're their friend, you get a front row seat. If you're their roommate, you might become involved in their drama.
3. Always in fights. They'll start fighting with you.
4. Crazy party animal. If they vomit, you might have to clean it up.
5. Snores.
6. Is a romantic interest. Don't, not until you've known them for longer than a few months.
7. Always has their romantic interest two feet away. That romantic interest will be an honorary roommate.
8. Is someone who constantly needs help or is struggling. You're likely to get wrapped up in their problems.

As a coincidence, these all apply to romantic partners too.
## The Academics
Everyone comes into college with different goals. Some people want to make their parents happy, some people want to learn as much as possible, some people want to graduate with a decent job that'll pay the bills, and some people are hell bent on proving their superiority through dominating every intellectual task thrown at them. It's up to you to figure out what kind of person you are!

I encourage you to really think about what you want out of college, ideally before you've even gone there. Write it down, make it real, tell your family and friends. It can change, and it really should change as you grow and mature, but setting these kinds of goals is important. Everything you do at college should be done to achieve this goal. Not to keep up with your peers, or to fit into the role of studious student. Just because everyone around you is doing something doesn't necessarily mean you should. It means you _probably_ should, because there is often wisdom in crowds, but if you want something different out of college, you'll probably end up doing different things in college.

With that being said, this guide will be written with the following goal:
**Have a memorable and positive college experience whilst setting yourself up for as good a job post-college as possible**
### Aim Big, Cut Aggressively
Before we can talk about all the stuff you should try to do, we should talk about the stuff you must do.

You must, at least, do the following:
1. Maintain your mental health to enable you to do the rest of the things on this list.
2. Pass enough classes to graduate
3. Obtain a job, eventually
4. Gather enough knowledge from college that you're not immediately fired

These are the critical four. If you don't achieve all of these, it doesn't really matter what else you did in college, you probably failed.

But I'd encourage attempting to do a lot more. It's a good idea to aim for a second major (or a minor), multiple tracks, clubs, other things I'll mention below. But before I mention all that it's worth emphasizing that you should aim big and cut aggressively. Make a list of things you could do and sort it in order of how much you think it'll help you reach your goals, meet with other people to get their input on your list. Asking on Reddit, asking your academic administrator, or running things by an upperclassman are all great methods.

Classify each thing you could do as having either a high or low quitting cost. This quitting cost is composed of two things, the immediate cost upon quitting and the invested effort you spent on the thing you quit. TAing has a high immediate cost to quit, it's not going to look good. A second major, entirely unrelated to your first, has a high invested cost to quit. It's unlikely you'll be able to use those classes for anything, and they'll represent a huge amount of wasted effort.

You should estimate the workload of your coming semester. If you quit all your low quitting cost responsibilities, it should be no higher than the amount of work you did your previous semester. The highest quitting cost activities you can have are:
1. Courses that are prerequisites, so almost all CS classes you'll be taking for the first 4 semesters.
2. TA positions at Purdue. Quit without a good excuse and you're unlikely to find another.
3. Leadership obligations. Same with #2, without a good reason you're unlikely to find another.
4. Relationships. Self explanatory.
5. Mentorship roles.
6. Classes with a focus on group projects (CS-307). If you took it with friends (which you should) you'll lose a lot of credibility.

You should have priorities, ordered by how expensive they are to quit and how valuable they are to your goals. You should start the semester with too much work, overestimate the amount of things you can do, but make sure you have a lot of stuff you can quit with no reprocussions. When anything high on the list of priorities becomes threatened (GPA, relationships) and _especially_ when any of the critical four are threatened cut, and cut aggressively.

If you're in danger of failing a class for your minor, use the time you used to be dedicating to a club to study. If you're failing a core class, drop the minor. People who are only used to success tend to aim far too low and then implode when they start failing. Do not attempt to make it all work, if you're struggling it's better to cut excess responsibility (especially if there's a low cost to quitting) than to risk any of the critical four.

Most often this will come in the form of accepting hits to your GPA. As are very difficult, Bs are much easier, and Cs are easier still. #3 on the critical four is helped by a good GPA, but it's a terrible idea to risk #1 or #2 in that process.  It might actually be optimal to accept a B in a class if it means having a weekend off when you really need it. Pushing through might result in you burning out hard and failing a class or suffering health complications.

It's always better to gracefully cut things low on your priority list rather than attempting to do it all and failing. Because when you fail, it's anyones guess what you might fail at. You could come back after an exam and shut down, unable to motivate yourself to study for the next one. You could stay up all night working on a club project and sleep through a morning meeting. You could forget about responsibilities, ignore your partner, lose friends, or have a nervous breakdown. Better to fail (or underperform) in a controlled manner than risk the things that are most important.
### Take Additional Classes
These classes can be in service of a major, minor, or just helping you graduate faster. The cost of quitting is really up to you here. If you plan things right and make sure you have easy off-ramps of transitioning majors into minors or reusing half completed minors to meet other requirements you might have no quitting cost at all. 

The best scenarios are ones in which you only need a few additional classes to get a major or minor. With the right CS classes, you only need one additional class to get a math minor. If you drop this class, you're not really losing much. All the other classes you took in service to your math minor are still helping you graduate. But if you take a bunch of classes for a major in Anthropology or something, then quit halfway through, it might end up being a massive waste of time.

It's worthwhile to schedule classes as though you're aiming for a minor, second major, or additional track(s). This results in taking more classes earlier, but even if you quit you'll still be able to use the classes you took. When in doubt, take classes that apply to multiple goals first. Delay classes that apply to only one major or track as long as possible. If you start getting overwhelmed, dropping the minor is just a matter of changing your future plans and rescheduling a few classes.
### Study Smarter
I've personally experienced quality studying methods moving me up 2 grades (B+ to A) without any corresponding increase in effort. Find people who are doing well in the classes you're in and copy their method. If it feels like it's not working, pivot quickly. Try as many things as possible until you find something that seems to work for you.

Classes often contain two things you need to study:
1. Procedural knowledge. How to do something. Like math.
2. Conceptual knowledge. What something is, does, or how it works. Like history.

All of calculus is procedural knowledge. Linear is procedural and a bit of conceptual. CS-180 changed since I took it, but it's mostly procedural. CS-240, CS-250, CS252 were a mixture of procedural and conceptual. CS-251 and CS-182 were procedural. If a class's exams involve doing some task with an objective right or wrong (FRQ coding, solving math problems), they're probably procedural. If they involve answering questions with facts or writing essays/short answers then they're probably conceptual.

Study procedural knowledge by performing the procedures you'll be tested on as often as possible, in as similar an environment to the test as possible. That means do study guides, write practice code problems for 240, 250, and 252, and do them repeatedly. Grade your work, if you did it wrong re-do it correctly. Most students will come in with only a conceptual, theoretical understanding. Practicing the procedure will make you far faster and much more correct.

Study conceptual knowledge with flashcards if it requires rote memorization (numbers, names, explicit associations between two things). If it's more complex than memorization, write free response questions and then try to write your entire understanding of a concept as fast as possible. Don't use the internet or outside help. After you're done, use the internet to edit your initial writing to make it better. Learning about paging? Write everything you know about paging down on a sheet of paper, then go to the slides to add all the facts you missed.

Do not mindlessly re-read notes except as a quick refresher before an exam. If you're not rephrasing it, remembering it, or learning it for the first time, you're probably not learning at all.
### Use TAs
I'm biased, obviously, but we do occasionally know what we're talking about. If you're stuck on something you could spend three hours figuring it out. Or you could show up to an office hour (or another lab session), ask a TA, and watch them solve it in five minutes.

Please at least attempt to solve it beforehand. Try to add a bunch of print statements and give the TAs information about what you've tried and what hasn't worked, too. It'll help us fix your issue far faster than if you just plop a computer down in front of us and go "it doesn't work". TAs become absolutely essential in CS250 and CS252 (what a coincidence... the classes I TA). 
### Academic Dishonesty
Cheating is difficult to catch (if done well) and incredibly rewarding in the short term. Cheating could be the best use of your time, it could potentially serve your goals. But most often cheating is done out of desperation and poor time management. Sloppy cheating is never the best use of your time, it is never optimal. It's more a signal that you've got too much on your plate, or that you lack time management skills. Every semester we tell people in CS-180 that they'll get caught if they copy-paste someone else's work. Every semester a horde of idiots does just that.

When talking about the risks of cheating, most obviously you could get caught. Purdue will not mess around, and you probably can't BS them once they're on to you. I know people who run academic integrity for the courses you'll probably be taking. It's difficult to tell who's using ChatGPT, but we've had decades of experience catching students who copy paste. If you do cheat, there's an automatic 0 on the assignment (duh). You're also likely to get your overall letter grade lowered (eg if you would have gotten an A now you get a B+ or a B) and could end up with your cheating recorded by the Office of the Dean of Students.

Another risk is that you don't learn class content. That's not too fine if it's some random class you're taking to meet an arbitrary graduation requirement. That's absolutely not fine if you're taking any of the following classes:
1. CS-180
2. CS-182
3. CS-240
4. CS-250
5. CS-251 if you plan on doing anything related to algorithms (eg CS-381)
6. CS-252 if you plan on doing anything related to systems (eg CS-354)
7. Calc 1 and Calc 2

Failing to understand the concepts presented in these classes will directly impact your performance in later classes. Even within a single class, failing to understand prerequisite material can result in you needing to cheat later on to maintain your performance. Professors can stay silent while they build an academic dishonesty case against you, and prolific enough cheating can incur serious penalties up to and including expulsion. If you have a history of cheating in Calc-1 and then attempt to cheat your way through Calc-2 and get caught you'll either have to risk further penalty by continuing to cheat or teach yourself all the concepts you missed in Calc-1 so you can complete the course authentically.

Never, ever cheat in CS-180. Not only do you run the risk of getting a permenant mark on your record for cheating in the easiest CS class in your easiest semester, but you run the risk of never learning core skills that you'll use for the rest of your degree (and career). If you cheat once or twice that is a strong sign that you struggle with time management, motivation, or some other core capability that almost guarantees your failure unless you fix it before classes get harder. CS-180 is a course that teaches you how to program by making you do lots of programming, it may feel fairly easy and full of repetition but the repetition will increase your speed, decrease the quantity of bugs you produce, and make the entire rest of college easier. Not to mention your first semester is crucial to building good habits that'll stick with you for the rest of college. That's assuming you don't get caught and still pass CS-180 too, which is not guaranteed if you cheat.

If you're seriously considering frequent cheating in CS-180 I'd advise dropping out or changing majors. The only scenario in which I could see that kind of cheating in CS-180 being a good idea is if those options weren't available to you (unsafe home environment and parents who would only pay for a CS degree, for example). Other than that, cheating is CS-180 is monumentally stupid. Not only are you cheating in a class that teaches core competencies, but you're likely too ignorant to understand what kind of information it's okay to skip out on learning and what's absolutely critical.

In general I'd say it's okay to:
1. Check answers with friends
2. Describe and clarify the requirements of a problem (eg clarifying a bad handout or something)
3. Describe how you solved a problem in English
4. Solve a problem/algorithm in English together, then go off and write your own code.

You start getting into cheating territory when you:
1. Edit someone else's code directly.
2. Tell someone the exact code you used.
3. Copy paste. Don't copy paste. You'll get caught, and it's stupid. Don't.
### Build Genuine Understanding (If You Want To)
You don't need to learn everything in every class at college. Most of the classes are pretty useful, that communications class is probably going to be pretty valuable in your future. But often times random gen-eds and high level classes in areas that don't interest you are going to be chock full of stuff you really don't care about. In those courses, your goal should be to get a good grade with minimal effort.

Now it's worth clarifying that you are human, and your judgement is flawed. You could catastrophically misjudge a course, decide that some topic is BS before realizing it's going to keep cropping up over and over again (cough concurrency cough), or fail to understand how a course might not help your academic understanding of computer science, but could be pretty useful in a job or your personal life. So min-maxxing for grades is a tool that should be used sparingly, and never on CS courses. But you can strategically dial back your effort into a course, even a CS course, that's not your focus in order to put more time into things that are.

However in the online gen-ed you're only taking for the credits? You should put in enough effort to get an A and no more, not unless that effort will help you achieve any of your goals. People reading this might be in the habit of thinking of themselves as hard working, studious people. Meaning they're unlikely to skip class or cram for exams. But it can absolutely be a good decision to skip classes and cram for exams. I've taken a handful of courses where I've gotten an A or A+ without ever going to class, did all the homework in the first week of the semester, and crammed the night before an exam.

The key is to decide what you want out of a course. In some cases that can only be the grade, for instance if you were taking classes for a language requirement but weren't interested in learning another language. In most CS classes that's going to be some mixture of grades and understanding. In the classes that pertain to the field you're most passionate about the scale will tilt much more towards genuine understanding.

If you want to understand the topics in a course:
1. Follow along with it as it's taught, don't learn the concepts before the exam.
2. Attend class.
3. Review what you learned in class afterwards.
4. Review frequently, even if only for a small amount of time.
5. Rephrase the knowledge, try to distill key concepts, write out everything you know about the subject, talk about it to your friends.

If you want to get a good grade in a course (with minimal time investment):
1. Skip classes if you can learn on your own faster.
2. Do as much homework as early as possible in the semester so it's out of the way.
3. Ignore class content until you get near an exam, then cram for the exam.
4. Put minimal effort into homework and assignments.

This comes with the caveat that this is risky. Until you're used to college it's not worth it to skip every class and learn content right before the exam. In fact, for many people that might be a totally invalid strategy. Additionally, like I said, our judgement is flawed. Especially when we're new to college. Early on attempting extreme time saving measures can hurt your grades or prevent you from learning things you really should've learned.

I'd recommend starting slow, dial back the effort in courses you don't need to much understanding in. If you're still getting good grades and doing well on exams feel free to dial back the effort even more. This comes with the inherent risk of a dark horse final coming out of nowhere and being far more difficult than the rest of the course. But running the risk of getting a B in a course you don't really care about can be worthwhile if it means getting an A in a course you do care about, or if you're doing more valuable things with your time. Understand that this comes with a risk, and should be done **carefully**, **slowly** and ideally _very little or not at all in your first semester_.

In STAT-511, a statistics course that I was required to take, I didn't care too much about the class. The concepts were easy enough to review on their own, most I'd already learned in AP Stats. I'd show up to class (attendance was required), put my earbuds in, and do other work. I'd zoom through the homeworks looking to complete them with minimal effort, then right before the exam I studied a ton. I got a 100%. Then I did the exact same thing for the final, which ended up being almost an entirely different format to the first exam and my overall grade got knocked down to a B+. If I'd had a better understanding of the course I could've gotten an A. But the time I saved in blitzing through this course, along with all the other ones that I'd gotten As in, was worth it for me. But this strategy is also uniquely well suited to me, I'm very good at teaching myself. It might be (probably is) terribly suited for you. Be very very careful when using it, never use it in a class you can't easily retake.
### White Whales
White Whales are classes the term I have for classes in which it is incredibly difficult to get an A, but comparatively easy to recieve a B or a C. Perfectionists will tank their mental health and put all their other grades at risk in order to achieve an A in a White Whale. This is an especially bad idea if the course is one they're not well suited for, isn't particularly useful for their future, or is irrelevant to their goals.

If you think it's achievable, then feel free to hunt that White Whale. But remember that your effort should be used in the most efficient manner possible. If your mental health is destroyed, you couldn't dedicate any time to your friends, job search, hobbies, or personal projects, and you run the risk of your grades slipping in other classes, that A really isn't worth it. I naturally tunnel vision, and I'm a bit of a perfectionist (when it comes to courses I care about). Sometimes that motivation can be great. But other times it makes me ignore things that would be better uses of my time in favor of chasing an A that's going to have an insignificant impact on my GPA.

It's also worth noting that you could be dumping a lot of effort into a strategy that's just not working. What might at first seem to be a white whale could be an easy A once you learn how to study for it. I took a history course that graded us off of in class essays. I could easily get Bs on the essays, but it was a struggle to get As. I studied and memorized a huge amount, and my grades climbed into the B+ range. But I was putting more effort into this history class than most of my CS classes. Then I figured out (stole) a better studying method, writing practice essays. Suddenly, with less effort, I was getting As.
## The Job Hunt
While academics tends to dominate the minds of students, the hunt for internships (and jobs) is equally as important. Not so much your freshman year (though you should turn up to a few career fairs to get used to it) but sophomore year and your internships can matter as much as (or more than) your grades.

Despite this, students tend to massively under-invest in finding an internship. This makes it comparatively easy to stand out in this regard as compared to something like, say, standing out in terms of GPA. Additionally, all of this stuff tends to be really low investment. Nobody's going to care if you decide that you can't show up at a career fair, or don't have time to tune your resume.

If you were willing to get Bs in a few hard classes instead of As (or Cs instead of Bs) it might lower your GPA by 0.1 or 0.2. But if you dedicate the massive amount of time you save to aggressively hunting for jobs or summer opportunities you're almost guaranteed to come out on top.

In your freshman year spend time asking people at career fairs what they look for on resumes, getting advice from upperclassmen and professors (though keep in mind that professors have been out of the market for a while), and make use of the many Purdue resources to help you get a job. Practice mock interviews, learn STAR questions, and it'll be easy to stand out. Most students put far, far too little effort into their internship hunt.
### Career Fairs
A few hours at a career fair can save you dozens attempting to apply online. Go to booths that have people who are actively interviewing people, not just advertising. If they have IPADs, take resumes, or have some software component where you register your attendance at the career fair those are the most valuable booths. If not, there's a chance you'll just be told to apply online and nothing you said to the recruiter will do anything to impact your chances.

Do research beforehand, create a list of companies you want to talk to. Prioritize those that seem to be doing interviews (as mentioned), google them in-depth while you're in line. Come off as curious, open to learn, but knowledgable. Don't try to outsmart the recruiter, be friendly, emphasize passion, experience, and anything unique that helps you stand out.
### Resume
Go to resume workshops, have people review it. For a few hours of investment you can see massive improvements in the kinds of positions you've got access to and how successful you are at applying. I don't know how to write a good resume, but other people do, you should seek their feedback constantly.
### Applying Online
Cover letters should be short, if you write them at all. They should be of the format "Hey, I'm __ from Purdue University, I think my skills in X and Y and my personal project Z would make me a good fit for this position." Don't use ChatGPT, don't glaze the company, just explain why you're a good fit for that position.

Apply early, apply to far more companies than you think you should. Aim for over 100 applications. Start applying almost as soon as school starts. This is less relevant in your freshman year. If you want a freshman internship, consider having rich parents with valauble industry connections.
### Do Your Own Research
Figure out what things have a disproportionate reward to effort ratio and do them. As I mentioned, practice interviews and STAR questions, go to career fairs, get your resume checked. But keep an eye out for opportunities similar to these, ask upperclassmen what they think is most valuable to do, always keep your head up.

When you're too busy you become task saturated. You can't keep an eye out for new opportunities that might be a better use of your time, because you're ultra-focused on completing the stuff you've already got to get done. This is another reason why it's a good idea to cut aggressively. Sure you could complete all those classes, but in doing so you might miss out on a resume workshop, never follow up with that girl who gave you her number, or never get around to emailing professors for research opportunities. Set aside dedicated time, especially at the beginning of each semester, to hunt for opportunities.

Don't limit yourself to the list, techniques, and tools on this list. Constantly evaluate what you're doing and if there's a more efficient way to achieve your goals.
## Extracurriculars
The quality of clubs, relevance of personal projects, and availability and benefit of things like research are going to be constantly shifting. You should
